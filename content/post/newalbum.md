This album collected Kvar_ispw17's finest tracks from 2014 to 2017, released under artist name "Kvar Ispw17" (aka. Ki17).

"Soul & Life" has 6 tracks added up to about 20 minutes:

# Tracks' Information

## Moon

This track was first appeared in my "Digital Monster: Tamer" album in 2015. The song is intended to describe an encounter with a grand moon pouring the moonlight in the room and clear the mood of the whole environment.

## Stars

This one was first in "STARS FOREST" in 2017, summer. It shows a starry night sky in the centre of the city, beyond the great buildings and the people in dreams.

## Missed in Rain

This was first in "MISSED IN THE RAIN" in 2014. This song was born with a _little_ special purpose.

## Forests

This tracks is the most noisy one in the album. The songs is also in "STARS FOREST" with "Stars". Under the help of the sample engine "Engine 2" could I draw a fantastic vivid secret forest scene.

## Graystripe

Yes. Graystripe is a character in my favourite book Warriors wrote by Erin Hunter, and it's a cat's name. The song meets the specific plot in the novel when Graystripe had to leave his own clan to raise his children.

## Winter

This song is really old. I use the GarageBand on iPad to finish this song in 2014. This is one of my earliest songs so it's even recorded directly on my instrument instead of using MIDI to connect to the computer.
