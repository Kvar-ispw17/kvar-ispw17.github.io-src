#### Why this name?

It's from a word "relax". I search "KiLExq" on Google and found that nobody used this name before (the name need to be unique and symbolic as I think).

#### How to ask for detailed information about KiLExq Studio?

Contact KiLExq Studio at [kilexqstudio@kvar-ispw17.tk](mailto:kilexqstudio@kvar-ispw17.tk).

#### Why use the free .tk domain?

First, this domain is fully functional and not too worse than other domain (Like cdn and email services).

Second, I'm still in high school with no job and I don't have any capital for doing this. The only income was from selling my music on the Internet music stores.

#### Why there are few products here?

The studio will go normal after I enter the university, when I would have time to do my hobby works (Impossible in high school). At that time, I will use my free time to work on my first studio production -> AN AMAZING INDIE GAME.
